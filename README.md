## Description 📌

        Mongo DB w/ Mongoose Schema

        A consumer will reach their fitness goals more quickly when they track their workout progress.

### As a user,
        👟 I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts.

        👟 I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day.

        👟 I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise.
        
        👟 If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.


## Installation 🛠

Be sure to initialize! Start the prompts by running 'node index.js' from the terminal.
